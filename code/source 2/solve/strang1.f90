! STRANG SPLITTING OF SCALAR REACTION TERM - 0.5*REACT, ADVECT, 0.5*REACT FOR
! FAST REACTIONS (TAU <= 1000), SEE RHS/RHS_SCL.F90 FOR SLOW REACTION SOURCES
! Strang splitting is a numerical method for solving differential equations that are decomposable into a sum of differential operators. used to speed up calculation for problems involving operators on very different time scales, for example, chemical reactions in fluid dynamics, and to solve multidimensional partial differential equations by reducing them to a sum of one-dimensional problems
!only called in les_mpi when looking at 1st and 3rd RK3 manipulation term and if reactions occur
!chemistry is integrated in two half steps, before and after the advection step
